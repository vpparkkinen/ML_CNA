# Causally interpreted machine learning with CNA

This repo contains code for simulations where various "explainable" ML techniques such as decision trees are used on binary data to learn putative sufficient conditions for an outcome, and [`cna`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cna/index.html) is used to minimize and combine those sufficient conditions to models that are causally interpretable in light of an INUS-theory of causation.

TO DO: test more ML techniques, (a lot of) documentation.
